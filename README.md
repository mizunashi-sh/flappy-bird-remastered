## Run this application
This application is developed with the Python Programming Language. Thus, Python3 is necessary if you need to run this application. Besides, you need to install *pygame* in order to run this application successfully.

### Install Python3
The installation guide of Python3 is [here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download).

### Install pygame
The installation guide of pygame is [here](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted#Pygame%20Installation).

### Run and Play
Open the folder where the project files are located in a command line window. Then, enter **py main.py** in this window to run this application.<br />
The rule of this game is similar to *Flappy Bird* by Dong Nguyen. The difference is that users need to tap the **Space key** to fly the bird.

### Attentions
According to the test result, this application can run smoothly on **Microsoft Windows**. However, it is not sure whether it can run on **Linux**, **OS X** or **others**. To run this application successfully on the platforms mentioned above, you may need to modify the source code or the resource files.

## Use the code
You can download, use and modify the source code as you want.

## Development Blueprint
It seems that this project will not be developed any more.
